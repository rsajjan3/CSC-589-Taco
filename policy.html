            <p class="text-justify"> We will not rent or sell any personally-identifying information to anyone. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Where possible, we aim to provide you with a fully functioning website — even if you do not supply personally-identifying information we request for site functionality. We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction of personally-identifying information. </p>
            <h3>What do we collect?</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                When you visit this site, we collect information about your visit of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available. This is information like:
                <ul>
                    <li>the time and date you visited the site</li>
                    <li>the first page you visit</li>
                    <li>how many times you click on links</li>
                    <li>how long you stayed on the site</li>
                    <li>the last page you visit before leaving</li>
                    <li>what site brought you to the page (if you followed a link form another page, like on a search engine or social media)</li>
                    <li>what sites you visited through links on our site</li>
                    <li>what you download from our site</li>
                    <li>what keyword or keywords you used if you found the site through a search engine</li>
                    <li>what browser you use</li>
                    <li>some of the plugins you use on your browser</li>
                    <li>what operating system you use</li>
                    <li>what kind of device you use (computer vs smartphone vs feature phone)</li>
                    <li>what brand device you use</li>
                    <li>what model device you use</li>
                    <li>your country</li>
                    <li>your IP address (we anonymise Visitors' IP addresses in our stats)</li>
                    <li>your screen resolution</li>
                    <li>language of your browser</li>
                    <li>number of times you have visited the site</li>
                    <li>days since the last time you visited the site</li>
                </ul>
                We do this to better understand how people use the site and so that we can fix problems with the site when they arise. From time to time, we also release reports that include very general information about who visits this site, like the total number of visitors or which countries or other websites comprise the most visits. We also collect information that is unique to you, like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We use this information to protect our servers from misuse. We do not use this information to identify FriendZone visitors. We may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to FriendZone. For instance, we assess how many visitors accessed our site over certain period of time and which pages were accessed most often. We do this so that we can figure out how we can improve the site and our content.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Use Policy Changes</h3>
            <p class="text-justify"> Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change FriendZone’s Data Use Policy from time to time, in responce to legal and technical changes and at our discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Data Use Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Data Use Policy constitutes your acceptance of these change.</p>
